But without check dams, \nrainwater would flow away, leaving the soil cracked  \nand parched. In 2016 and 2017, we didn\u2019t have a  \ndrop of water.  \nHearing our cries for help, Pidilite advocated for us with \nthe Gujarat Government, resulting in one of the longest \ncheck dams to be built by the company.  \nGroundwater recharge brought our ancient wells and \nborewells to life, by significantly increasing the water \nlevels. We no longer need to buy water from tankers. \nThe farming season has increased. Our cotton yield  \nhas expanded. We were also able to grow jowar on\n5-7 bighas of land-in just one year!  \nWith Pidilite\u2019s help, the Rangholi River brings colour  \nand crops to our land.\nAshok Humbal\nZanzmer, Umrala, Bhavnagar\nRunaway River\nPidilite tames Rangholi River with \nvital check dams\nYEAR: 2022-23\nCHECK DAM (ONE OF THE LONGEST \nCHECK DAMS BUILT BY PIDILITE IN \nCOLLABORATION WITH IRRIGATION \nDEPARTMENT (GOVT.
