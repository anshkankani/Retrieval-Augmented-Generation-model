Expected credit losses are weighted average of credit losses with \nthe respective risks of default occurring as the weights. Credit loss is the difference between all contractual cash \nflows that are due to the Company in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Company \nexpects to receive, discounted at original effective rate of interest.\n For Trade receivables, the Company measures loss allowance at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit \nlosses. The Company computes expected credit loss allowance based on a provision matrix which takes into \naccount historical credit loss experience and adjusted for forward-looking information.\n2.14.4 Financial Liabilities and equity instruments\n2.14.4.1 Classification of debt or equity", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 119}, "type": "Document"}}
