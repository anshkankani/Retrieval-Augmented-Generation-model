When the Group has less than a \nmajority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over the investee when the voting rights are sufficient \nto give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee unilaterally. The Group considers all \nrelevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not the Group\u2019s voting rights in an investee are sufficient \nto give it power, including:\n \u2022  the size of the Group\u2019s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of the other vote \nholders;\n \u2022  potential voting rights held by the Group, other vote holders or other parties;\n \u2022  rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and\n \u2022  any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Group has, or does not have, the current ability to  \ndirect the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, including voting patterns at previous \nshareholders meetings.\n  Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the \nGroup loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed off \nduring the year are included in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss from the date the Group gains control \nuntil the date when the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\n If the Group losses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (including goodwill), liabilities, \nnon-controlling interest and other components of equity. Any investment retained is measured at fair value. Any \nresultant gain or loss is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity \ntransaction.", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 199}, "type": "Document"}}
