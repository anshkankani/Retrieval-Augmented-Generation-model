Remeasurement recognised in Other Comprehensive Income is reflected \nimmediately in retained earnings and is not reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised immediately \nfor both vested and the non-vested portion. The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet \nrepresents the present value of the defined benefit obligation, as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. \nAny asset resulting from this calculation is limited taking into account the present value of available refunds and \nreductions in future contributions to the schemes.", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 120}, "type": "Document"}}
