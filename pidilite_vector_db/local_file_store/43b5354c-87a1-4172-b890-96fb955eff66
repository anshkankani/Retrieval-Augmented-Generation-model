They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and \nimpairment losses.\n  Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the \nlease term and useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the  \npurpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the \nvalue-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cashflows that are \nlargely independent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash \nGenerating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The \nlease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using \nthe incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a \ncorresponding adjustment to the related Right-of-use asset if the Company changes its assessment if whether it \nwill exercise an extension or a termination option.\n Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have \nbeen classified as financing activity under cash flows.     \n2.5.2 Company as Lessor\n Rental income from leases is recognised on a straight- line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
