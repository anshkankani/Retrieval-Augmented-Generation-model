If any \nsuch indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the \nimpairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the \nCompany estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a \nreasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual \ncash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a \nreasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.\n Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for \nimpairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
