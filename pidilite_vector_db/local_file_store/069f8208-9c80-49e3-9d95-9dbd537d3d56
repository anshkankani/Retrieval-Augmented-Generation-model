Intangible assets \nwith indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment annually at the cash-generating unit level. The assessment of \nindefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite life continues to be supportable. If \nnot, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.\n Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. \n If the recoverable amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, \nthe carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment \nloss is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.\n2.14 Inventories\n Inventories are valued at lower of cost and net realisable value. \n Cost of inventories is determined on weighted average. Cost for this purpose includes cost of direct materials, \ndirect labour and appropriate share of overheads. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the \nordinary course of business less all estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n Obsolete, defective, unserviceable and slow / non-moving stocks are duly provided for and valued at net  \nrealisable value.\n2.15 Provisions (other than Employee Benefits)\n A provision is recognised when as a result of past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 205}, "type": "Document"}}
