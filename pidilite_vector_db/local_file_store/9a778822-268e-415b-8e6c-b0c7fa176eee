Every grain of sand, \nleaf and plant in my 25 bighas of land is mine to  \ncherish. Why would I pollute or poison this precious \nground?  So, I chose the \u201cIntegrated Farming\u201d  \napproach - a practice that rewards our farm with \nmultiple sources of income.\nIntegrated farming requires an increased income,  \nand Gram Nirman Samaj (GNS) and the Pidilite team \nsupported me with financial and farming aid. This \nincreased my annual earnings considerably. Going \norganic has transformed my land. My farm is now \nrecognised for its Orchard Project, Kitchen Garden Plot, \nShade Net House, Vermi-composting Unit, Honey Bee \nHive and Gobar Gas Project.\nHowever, my greatest reward is watching fellow farmers \nembracing sustainable practises. Today, GNS and Pidilite \nare training 18000+ farmers in scientific practices that \nenhance cotton, groundnut and onion crops.\nDangar Khimabhai Patabhai\nMota Khuntavada village\nNatural Farming initiative  \nat Mota Khuntavada\nHow Dangar Khimabhai Patabhai \nintroduced Integrated Farming \non his 25 Bighas of Land \nONE-ACRE WADIS \nFOR VEGETABLE \nAND FRUIT CROPS84\nAVERAGE INCREASE \nIN FARMER\u2019S INCOME \nTHROUGH ONE-ACRE \nWADIS1 Lakh/Annum\nTOTAL NUMBER OF\nFARMERS WHO HAVE \nADOPTED NATURAL \nFARMINGFARMERS TRAINED IN \nSCIENTIFIC PRACTICES3,500 +18,000 +", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 6}, "type": "Document"}}
