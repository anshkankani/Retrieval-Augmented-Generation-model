Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose \nof impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value-\nin-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generate cashflows that are largely \nindependent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash \nGenerating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.  .\n The lease liability is initially measured at amortized cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The \nlease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using \nthe incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of these leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a \ncorresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Group changes its assessment if whether it will \nexercise an extension or a termination option.    \n Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been \nclassified as financing activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n2.8 Foreign Currencies\n The functional currency of the Parent and its Indian Subsidiaries is the Indian Rupee, whereas the functional \ncurrency of Foreign Subsidiaries is the currency of their countries of domicile.
