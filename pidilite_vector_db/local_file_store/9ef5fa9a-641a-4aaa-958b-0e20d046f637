To assess whether a \ncontract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (i) the contract \ninvolves the use of an identified asset, (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of \nthe asset through the period of the lease and (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (\u201cROU\u201d) and a \ncorresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve \nmonths or less (short - term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company \nrecognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.\n Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. \nROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised.", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 115}, "type": "Document"}}
