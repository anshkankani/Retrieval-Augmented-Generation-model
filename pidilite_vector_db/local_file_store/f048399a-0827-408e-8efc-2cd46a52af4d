Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, \nbut is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always \ndetect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud \nor error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could \nreasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the \nbasis of this Standalone Financial Results. \nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and \nmaintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Annual Standalone \nFinancial Results, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit \nprocedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient \nand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from \nerror, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, \nmisrepresentations, or the override of internal control. \n\u2022 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to \ndesign audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for \nthe purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's \ninternal control. \n\u2022 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness \nof accounting estimates made by the Board of Directors.", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Q4-FY23-Results-uploaded.pdf", "page": 8}, "type": "Document"}}
