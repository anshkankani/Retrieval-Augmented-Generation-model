The \nhospital in Bhavnagar, where most patients go, was a \nhundred kilometres away. Luckily, Hanumant Hospital \nwhich is a multi-speciality hospital, was close at hand.\nOnce I was admitted, Dr. Azim Qureshi was able to \ndiscover and diagnose a cyst through an ultrasound and \nCT scan. He immediately moved my case to Dr. Ritika \nGanatra, the hospital\u2019s full-time gynaecologist. With \nthe whole team\u2019s dedicated efforts, I was successfully \noperated within 3 days under the \u201cAyushman Bharat \nYojna\u201d program. During this incredibly complex surgery, \nthey removed a 24 x 24 cm ovarian cyst along with \nanother cyst measuring 10 x 12 cm.\nSurgery and recovery can feel like a lonely and \nconfusing experience, but with this skilled team, I was \nthankful to be in the right hands, at the right place.\nMrs. Raniben\nUna, Gir Gadhada\nOUTPATIENTS \nTREATED45,500 +\nSURGERIES \nPERFORMED3,100 +EMERGENCY \nCASES HANDLED12,500 +", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 10}, "type": "Document"}}
