Remeasurement recognised in Other Comprehensive Income is reflected in retained \nearnings and is not reclassified to profit or loss. Past service cost is recognised immediately for both vested and the \nnon-vested portion. The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet represents the \npresent value of the defined benefit obligation, as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting \nfrom this calculation is limited taking into account the present value of available refunds and reductions in future \ncontributions to the schemes.\n2.19.3 Short-Term and Other Long-Term Employee Benefits     \n A liability is recognised for benefits accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and sick \nleave in the period the related service is rendered at the undiscounted amount of the benefits expected to be paid \nin exchange for that service.\n Liabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscounted amount of the \nbenefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 207}, "type": "Document"}}
