Deferred tax assets are \ngenerally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits \nwill be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. \n The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the \nextent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to \nbe recovered.\n Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in \nwhich the liability is settled or the asset realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or \nsubstantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.\n The measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the \nmanner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of \nits assets and liabilities.", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 203}, "type": "Document"}}
