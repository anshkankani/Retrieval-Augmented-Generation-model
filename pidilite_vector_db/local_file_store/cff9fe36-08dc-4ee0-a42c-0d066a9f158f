Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial \nasset quickly at close to its fair value.\nThe Group has an established liquidity risk management framework for managing its short term, medium term and long term \nfunding and liquidity management requirements. The Group\u2019s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from mismatches of the \nmaturities of financial assets and liabilities. The Group manages the liquidity risk by maintaining adequate credit facilities in cash \nand cash equivalents. The Group also has adequate credit facilities agreed with banks to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet \nall its normal operating commitments in a timely and cost-effective manner.\n(i) Liquidity risk tables\nThe following tables detail the Group\u2019s remaining contractual maturity for its derivative and non-derivative financial liabilities with \nagreed repayment periods. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on \nthe earliest date on which the Group will be liable to pay.\nThe tables include both interest and principal cash flows.
