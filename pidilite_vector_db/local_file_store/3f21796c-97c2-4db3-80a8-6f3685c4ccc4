Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their \nestimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each \nreporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated  \nimpairment losses.\n2.10.2 Intangible assets acquired in a business combination\n Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially \nrecognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).\n Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less \naccumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are  \nacquired separately.    \n2.10.3 Internally generated Intangible Assets \u2013 Research and Development Expenditure\n Expenditure on research activities is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which it is incurred.\n An internally generated intangible asset arising from development is recognised if and only if it meets the \nrecognition criteria of intangible assets. The amount initially recognised is the sum total of expenditure incurred \nfrom the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria. Where no intangible asset can be \nrecognised, development expenditure is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which  \nit is incurred.", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 118}, "type": "Document"}}
