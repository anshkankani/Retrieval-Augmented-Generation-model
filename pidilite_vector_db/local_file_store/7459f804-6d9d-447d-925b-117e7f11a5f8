Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, \nbut is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance \nwith SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it \nexists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they \ncould reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone \nfinancial statements.\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism \nthroughout the audit. We also:\n\u2022 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of \nthe standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud \nor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive \nto those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The \nrisk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting \nfrom fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 102}, "type": "Document"}}
