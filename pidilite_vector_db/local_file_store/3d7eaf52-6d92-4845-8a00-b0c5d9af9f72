The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the \nlease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate.  \n Ind AS 116 requires lessees to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any \noption to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an \nassessment on the expected lease term on a lease-by-lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably \ncertain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the \nCompany considers factors such as any significant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, \ncosts relating to the termination of the lease and the importance of the underlying asset to operations taking into \naccount the location of the underlying asset and the availability of suitable alternatives. The lease term in future \nperiods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term reflects the current economic circumstances. \n The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for \na portfolio of leases with similar characteristics. \n3.1.7 Recent accounting pronouncements\n Ministry of Corporate Affairs (\u201cMCA\u201d) notifies new standards or amendments to the existing standards under \nCompanies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time.
