The Group enters in to contracts with terms upto 90 days. The Group\u2019s philosophy does \nnot permit any speculative calls on the currency. It is driven by conservatism which guides that we follow conventional \nwisdom by use of Forward contracts in respect of Trade transactions.\nRegulatory Requirements: The Group will alter its hedge strategy in relation to the prevailing regulatory framework and \nguidelines that may be issued by RBI, FEDAI, ISDA or other regulatory bodies from time to time.\nMode of taking Cover: Based on the outstanding details of import payable and exports receivable (in weekly baskets) the net \ntrade import exposure is arrived at (i.e. Imports \u2013 Exports = Net trade exposures).
