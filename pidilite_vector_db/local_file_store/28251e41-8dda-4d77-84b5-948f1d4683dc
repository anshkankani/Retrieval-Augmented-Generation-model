Revenue is recognised when it is realized or is realizable and \nhas been earned after the deduction of variable components such as discounts, rebates, incentives, promotional \ncouponing and schemes. The company estimates the amount of variable components based on historical, current \nand forecast information available and either expected value method or most likely method, as appropriate and \nrecords a corresponding liability in other payables; the actual amounts may be different from such estimates. These \ndifferences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a \nsubsequent period.\n2.4.1.a Sale of Goods\n Revenue is recognised when control of the products being sold has been transferred to a customer and when \nthere are no longer any unfulfilled obligations to the customer. This is generally on delivery to the customer but \ndepending on individual customer terms, this can be at the time of dispatch, delivery or upon formal customer \nacceptance. This is considered the appropriate point where the performance obligations in our contracts are \nsatisfied and the Company no longer has control over the inventory.\n Advance received from customer before transfer of control of goods to the customer is recognised as  \ncontract liability.\n2.4.1.b Sale of Services\n Revenue from sale of services includes fixed price contracts and time and material contracts and is recognized as \nsale, as and when the related services are performed and certified by the client. Incomplete services are recorded at \ncost as work-in-progress.", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 115}, "type": "Document"}}
