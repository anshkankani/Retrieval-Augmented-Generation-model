But we women were determined \nto offer our children a future that didn\u2019t depend on daily \nwages like ours. \nAloe Vera had been growing wild in our village for years. \nPidilite recognised its potential as an income generator \nthrough value addition. They identified forest areas \nwhere it grew naturally and in abundance, and supported \nour Self Help Group (SHG). They not only helped us in \nsetting up a production unit but also provided marketing \nassistance, logistical support, and valuable guidance. \nWe kickstarted our venture with 8 women and a small \ncrusher.  As the orders increased, land was purchased \nand a new unit built. Today, over 40 women produce \n1000+ litres of aloe vera juice per day and it\u2019s still not \nenough to fulfil the growing demand. \nAloe Vera has helped us run the house, educate our  \nkids, and repay our debts. Now our children can have \na brighter future.Mrs. Kavad Baghuben Nathabhai \nBildi Village\nALOE VERA JUICE TURNOVER1,32,96,000`\nSANITIZER TURNOVER25,86,000`NEW SELF\nHELP GROUPS\nDEVELOPED110\nTOTAL STRENGTH \nOF WOMEN IMPACTED\nACROSS ALL SHGs7,800 +", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 5}, "type": "Document"}}
