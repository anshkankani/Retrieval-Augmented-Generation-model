The amount initially recognised is the sum total of expenditure incurred \nfrom the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria. Where no intangible asset can be \nrecognised, development expenditure is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in \nwhich it is incurred.\n Subsequent to initial recognition, internally generated intangible assets are reported at cost less accumulated \namortization and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets acquired separately.\n2.12.4 Useful lives of Intangible Assets\n Estimated useful lives of the Intangible Assets are as follows:\nType of Asset Useful Life\nComputer Software 3-10 years\nTechnical Knowhow 10-15 years\nNon-Compete Fees 7-15 years\nDistribution Network 15 years\nCopyrights Indefinite Life\nTrademark Indefinite Life\n2.13 Impairment of Tangible and Intangible Assets other than Goodwill   \n At the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible \nassets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any \nsuch indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of \nthe impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, \nthe Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
