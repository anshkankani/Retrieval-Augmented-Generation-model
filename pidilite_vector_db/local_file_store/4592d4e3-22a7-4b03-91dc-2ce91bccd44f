Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a \nbusiness is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less accumulated impairment \nlosses, if any.\n For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company\u2019s cash-generating units \n(or groups of cash-generating units) that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. A cash-\ngenerating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when \nthere is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less \nthan its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill \nallocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each assets \nin the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised directly in Statement of Profit and Loss. An impairment \nloss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.Notes Forming Part of The Financial Statements", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 114}, "type": "Document"}}
