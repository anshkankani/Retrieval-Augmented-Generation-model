The Company\u2019s \nexposure and credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions is reasonably \nspread amongst the counterparties.\nCredit risk arising from investment in mutual funds, derivative financial instruments and other balances with banks is limited and \nthere is no collateral held against these because the counterparties are banks and recognised financial institutions with high credit \nratings assigned by the international credit rating agencies.\n(G) Liquidity risk management\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in raising funds to meet commitments associated with financial \ninstruments that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Liquidity risk may result from an inability to sell a financial \nasset quickly at close to its fair value.\nThe Company has an established liquidity risk management framework for managing its short term, medium term and long term", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 162}, "type": "Document"}}
