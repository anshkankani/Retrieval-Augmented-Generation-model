Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is \nsubsequently (after the measurement period) remeasured at subsequent reporting dates with the corresponding \ngain or loss being recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss.\n In case of business combinations involving entities under common control, the above policy does not apply. \nBusiness combinations involving entities under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interests \nmethod. The net assets of the transferor entity or business are accounted at their carrying amounts on the date \nof the acquisition subject to necessary adjustments required to harmonise accounting policies. Retained earnings \nappearing in the financial statements of the transferor is aggregated with the corresponding balance appearing \nin the financial statements of the transferee. Identity of the reserves appearing in the financial statements of the \ntransferor is preserved and appears in the financial statements of the transferee in the same form. Any excess or \nshortfall of consideration paid over share capital and reserves of transferor entity is recognised as capital reserve \nunder equity.\n2.3 Goodwill", "metadata": {"source": "/content/drive/MyDrive/pidilite/Annual-Report-2022-2023.pdf", "page": 114}, "type": "Document"}}
